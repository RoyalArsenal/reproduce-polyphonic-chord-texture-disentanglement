# reproduce-polyphonic-chord-texture-disentanglement
This is a reproduction of the repository of the paper: Wang et al., Learning interpretable representation for controllable polyphonic music generation, ISMIR 2020.

This repository forks from https://github.com/ZZWaang/polyphonic-chord-texture-disentanglement.

The reproduction is available through the new added notebook file *reproduce.ipynb*, with brief explanations. For the full PDF report of explanation to this reproduction, see https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lrxqN0qEgxHbDyfoFDDJJhp9-LupxFkH/view?usp=share_link.

I will list the access to another two research reports of mine below. They are mostly mathematics. View them if you are interested.
